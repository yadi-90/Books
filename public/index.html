        <p><b>Magic realism,</b> also known as magical realism, is a literary and artistic genre that blends elements of reality and the 
            fantastical in a seamless and often ambiguous way. It originated in Latin American literature and has since spread to other
             parts of the world. Magic realism presents extraordinary or supernatural events in a matter-of-fact manner, blurring the line 
             between reality and fantasy. Unlike traditional fantasy genres where the fantastical elements are presented as extraordinary 
             occurrences in a separate world, magic realism introduces these elements into the everyday reality of the characters and setting.</p>

            <li>
                <strong>Blurring of Reality and Fantasy:</strong> In magic realism, 
                fantastical events or elements are treated as normal aspects 
                of the characters' lives and the world they inhabit. This creates 
                a sense of ambiguity, as the boundaries between the real and the magical
                 are intentionally blurred.
            </li>  
      
            <li>
                <strong>Narrative Tone: </strong>Magic realism often employs a straightforward and realistic
                 narrative tone, which makes the fantastical elements seem more convincing and 
                 grounded. The ordinary and extraordinary coexist without explicit commentary.
            </li>
         
            <li>
                <strong>Cultural Context:</strong>Magic realism is often deeply rooted in cultural, historical,
                 and social contexts. It can be used to reflect on cultural beliefs, myths, and 
                 the complexities of the human experience.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Everyday Magic:</strong> Mundane and ordinary events are often portrayed with the same 
                significance as magical ones. This treatment of the ordinary as extraordinary 
                contributes to the genre's unique atmosphere.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Symbolism and Metaphor:</strong> The fantastical elements in magic realism often carry 
                symbolic or metaphorical meanings. They might represent emotional states, 
                societal issues, or philosophical concepts.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Reader's Perspective:</strong> Magic realism can be open to interpretation, encouraging
                 readers to engage actively with the text to discern the underlying meanings and themes.  
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Inherent Acceptance: </strong>Characters within the story typically accept the magical occurrences 
                without much surprise or questioning, mirroring the way the reader is expected to accept 
                these events as a natural part of the story's world.

            In visual arts, magic realism can also be seen in the works of artists like Frida Kahlo and René Magritte, where elements
             of the fantastic are seamlessly integrated into realistic portrayals.

            Overall, magic realism offers a unique way to challenge conventional notions of reality, inviting audiences to contemplate
             the extraordinary within the ordinary and to explore the deeper layers of meaning beneath the surface of the narrative.
